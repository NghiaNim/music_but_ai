# Project Conventions

## No Documentation Outside the PRD

- The ONLY documentation file is `classical-music-connect-plan.md` at the repo root.
- Do NOT create README.md, CHANGELOG.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, or any other markdown docs.
- Update `classical-music-connect-plan.md` as features are built to reflect current state.
- Code comments should be minimal and only explain non-obvious intent.

## Monorepo File Structure

```
apps/
  nextjs/          → Next.js web app (App Router)
  expo/            → Expo mobile app
packages/
  api/             → tRPC routers (shared backend logic)
  db/              → Drizzle ORM + schema (PostgreSQL)
  ai/              → AI concierge logic (Anthropic Claude)
  auth/            → Better Auth
  ui/              → Shared UI components (shadcn/ui)
  validators/      → Shared Zod schemas
tooling/
  eslint/
  typescript/
  tailwind/
  prettier/
```

- New tRPC routers go in `packages/api/src/router/`.
- New DB tables go in `packages/db/src/schema.ts`.
- Shared Zod validators go in `packages/validators/src/`.
- AI logic (prompts, streaming) lives in `packages/ai/src/`.
- Next.js pages use App Router conventions in `apps/nextjs/src/app/`.
- Colocate page-specific components in `_components/` directories.
