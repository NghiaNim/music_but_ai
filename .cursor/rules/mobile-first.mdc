# Mobile-First Development

The Next.js web app should feel like a native mobile app, mirroring the Expo experience.

## Layout

- Design for 375px viewport first, then scale up with responsive breakpoints.
- Use a persistent bottom navigation bar (like iOS/Android tab bar) as the primary nav.
- Avoid wide desktop-only layouts. Content should be single-column by default.
- Use `max-w-md mx-auto` or similar to constrain content width on larger screens.

## Navigation

- Bottom tab bar is the primary navigation (Home, Learn, Events, AI Mentor, Profile).
- Top nav bar is minimal — app title/logo only, no duplicate nav links.
- Use full-screen page transitions, not nested sidebars.

## Components

- Touch-friendly tap targets (min 44px height for interactive elements).
- Use cards, bottom sheets, and full-screen modals — not dropdowns or popovers.
- Prefer vertical scrolling lists over grids on small screens.
- Skeleton loading states for all async content.

## Shared Patterns with Expo

- Components should be structured so logic can be shared with React Native.
- Keep platform-specific styling in the component layer, business logic in packages/.
- Use the same tRPC queries and mutations across both platforms.
